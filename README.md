This application allows you to categorize tasks translated from the PyBossa
application [app-translate](https://github.com/citizen-cyberscience-centre/app-translate)


**NOTE**: there is no tutorial and the tasks are just the output of the
[app-translate](https://github.com/citizen-cyberscience-centre/app-translate)
task runs. Thus, if you want to use this application, use first
app-translate.
